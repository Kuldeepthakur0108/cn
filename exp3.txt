Wireshark is a network analysis tool that captures data packets in real time and shows them in an easy-to-understand format. It has filters, color coding, and other tools that help you examine network traffic and check each packet in detail.


Features of Wireshark:

It runs on many operating systems like Windows, Linux, and Mac.

It captures and shows all network packets in a clear, detailed format.

It supports deep analysis of many different network protocols.

It provides live packet capture from different network interfaces.

It allows filtering and sorting to easily find specific network data.



✅ 1. dns in Wireshark – Why we use it

To see how domain names are converted to IP addresses.

To check if DNS is working properly.

To troubleshoot issues like “website not opening.”

(When you apply a DNS filter like dns, you only see DNS-related packets.)



✅ 2. frame in Wireshark – Why we use it

To view the packet at its lowest (layer 2) level.

To see details like time captured, packet size, and physical layer info.

It gives a summary of the whole packet as captured by Wireshark.

(Applying frame filters helps analyze packet timing, size, etc.)



✅ 3. udp.stream eq 17 in Wireshark – Why we use it

To follow or isolate one specific UDP conversation.

It shows only packets belonging to stream number 17.

Helps analyze VoIP calls, gaming traffic, DNS replies, etc. clearly.

(Every UDP flow gets a stream number. Using this filter focuses on just that flow.)



✅ 4. !(udp.stream == 19) – Why we use it

This filter means: “Show everything EXCEPT UDP stream 19.”

It hides packets from stream 19.

Used when one stream is noisy or unwanted.

Helps focus on all other traffic by removing one specific flow.

Example:
If UDP stream 19 is generating too many packets, using this filter removes it so you can study the rest easily.
